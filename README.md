👋🏻 **HELLO** and welcome!!

Alexis here, great to have you. 

I take copious notes with Obsidian and journal daily.

If you do, too, maybe the following sounds familiar :)

## A FUCKING CONUNDRUM

I LOVE journaling with pen and paper in the morning.

Journaling gives me a safe space where **I let my heart speak**. 

This makes me feel safe.

I also LOVE note-taking with Obsidian. 

It gives me an exciting space where **I let my mind wander**.

That makes me feel like a million bucks.

But… 

Here’s the RUB.

### Problem #1: Peace without a future

When I journal with pen and paper, **I can’t link to Obsidian**.

**There is no easy way to link to a note** in Obsidian without losing the peace and quiet that I cherish. 

So, none of my heart-felt writings will be ever leverage the 6,018 notes in Obsidian because they’re stuck on paper???

Fuck.

### Problem #2: Writing as exciting as pink noise

And when I try to journal in Obsidian, **it’s extremely hard to focus**.

Either…

My **mind wanders off to far** by following one of the 6,018 rabbit-holes I’ve stored in my vault.

OR **my inner editor criticises my spelling** as I type, ensuring no creativity is left.

So, my notes in Obsidian will perpetually lack real depth and a heart-felt spontaneity that makes them sparkle???

FUCK!

# Streamline is a stream-of-consciousness writer for Obsidian users

So I built Streamline.

It’s a *writer* that helps me:

…**Enter** that quiet journaling space.

…AND **Link** to my notes easily without getting pulled away.

…AND **Let go** of my inner editor by removing most normal editor features.

### A completely new journaling flow
Instead of journaling by hand, I now do a quick, relaxed Streamline session.

Usually right after I log in to my laptop. 

The built-in unobtrusive search lets me insert links to Obsidian quickly. 

Then I save it as a markdown note to my vault.

It’s really simple.

It works. 

And it feels right.

So… If *you* struggle with what I’m talking about. 

Know that you’re NOT crazy and you’re NOT alone.

Instead: Give your heart a chance to speak AND your mind a place to wander!

Also, Streamline is free and open-source.

## What you’ll get

### Learn to listen to your heart
If you’ve never done stream-of-consciousness writing before, it can seem daunting and confusing. 

All you need to do is write one word that’s on your mind right now. 

There is no hurry. You can type as slow or fast as you like. 

With a bit of practice, you’ll be able to hear that quiet inner voice. 

You’ll see.

Your heart has some really important things to say.

### Learn to love your mistakes
Streamline is a writer, not an editor. 

It only moves *forward*. 

When you make a tYpO, there is no DELETE key. 

You can’t change the mistake. 

What you can do is continue moving forward regardless. 

With a little practice, you’ll start focusing on your flow.

(No worries, you can save your writing to markdown and give it the old editor treatment later.)

### Learn to link a lot

As you’re writing you can link to a note in Obsidian easily:

- **Enter** linking mode by typing `[[`
- **Exit** the linking mode with ESC
- **Choose** a link with your UP and DOWN arrow keys
- **Insert** the link into your stream with RETURN

It takes less than a minute to learn 

Once you use it the results are remarkable:

I pepper more links into my journal notes than I do with Obsidian proper.

## What you’ll miss

Again, Streamline is a writer, not an editor. 

It intentionally only *moves forward*. 

- There is **no backspace** to delete a mistake
- There are **no paragraphs** to get off-track
- There is **no markdown syntax highlighting** to distract 
- There is **no copy-and-paste** or any other shortcuts

Streamline is free and [open-source](https://github.com/akaalias/Streamline)!
